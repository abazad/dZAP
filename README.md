##About:

 Doktor ZAP is a graphical (TK) python Whatsapp client based on Yowsup. Read that module's docs for info on registration, and fundamentals if you're planning to modify this interface. There is some emphasis on message automation (aka a BOT) here, and the functions on this aspect that retrieve data from various websites (I tailored for my personal suit) return PT-BR text. You can use them as a direction to make your own.

##Dependencies:

YOWSUP:  https://github.com/tgalal/yowsup

## Run:

Extract all and run doktorzap_run.py


## TIP

 If you invite anyone who's not in your contact list to a group, you will get banned from whatsapp's network for 24h. They will know you are using a non-official client, so they ban, because this action is not possible on the original app. *you will get banned on the second event of this nature.
 Maybe other actions like massively broadcasting a message will also result in ban.
